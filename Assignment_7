Python Basic - 2

Q.1. Create two int type variables, apply addition, subtraction, division and multiplications
and store the results in variables. Then print the data in the following format by calling the
variables:
First variable is __ & second variable is __.
Addition: __ + __ = __
Subtraction: __ - __ = __
Multiplication: __ * __ = __
Division: __ / __ = __

Ans.  *Addition:
              a=10
              b=2
              c=a+b
              print(f'First variable is {a} & second variable is {b}')
              print(f'Addition: {a} + {b} = {c}')

      *Subtraction: 
              a=10
              b=2
              c=a-b
              print(f'First variable is {a} & second variable is {b}')
              print(f'Subtraction: {a} - {b} = {c}')

      *Multiplication:
              a=10
              b=2
              c=a*b
              print(f'First variable is {a} & second variable is {b}')
              print(f'Multiplication: {a} * {b} = {c}')

      *Division:
              a=10
              b=2
              c=a*b
              print(f'First variable is {a} & second variable is {b}')
              print(f'Division: {a} / {b} = {c}')

Q.2. What is the difference between the following operators:
(i) ‘/’ & ‘//’
(ii) ‘**’ & ‘^’


Q.3. List the logical operators.
Q.4. Explain right shift operator and left shift operator with examples.
Q.5. Create a list containing int type data of length 15. Then write a code to check if 10 is
present in the list or not.
