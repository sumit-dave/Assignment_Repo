1. What is the role of try and exception block?
Ans.  We use try and exception block to handle exceptions in code. Exceptions are unexpected events that can disrupt the normal flow of 
      code execution. They can occur due to various reasons, such as invalid input, unexpected conditions, resource unavailability, and 
      more.
      *Try block: In try block we place the code which can raise error in it
      *Except bloc: If an exception occurs within the "try" block, the control of the program is transferred to the"except" block, 
       allowing you to take appropriate actions to handle the exception.

2. What is the syntax for a basic try-except block?
3. What happens if an exception occurs inside a try block and there is no matching
except block?
4. What is the difference between using a bare except block and specifying a specific
exception type?
5. Can you have nested try-except blocks in Python? If yes, then give an example.
6. Can we use multiple exception blocks, if yes then give an example.
7. Write the reason due to which following errors are raised:
a. EOFError
b. FloatingPointError
c. IndexError
d. MemoryError
e. OverflowError
f. TabError
g. ValueError
8. Write code for the following given scenario and add try-exception block to it.
a. Program to divide two numbers
b. Program to convert a string to an integer
c. Program to access an element in a list
d. Program to handle a specific exception
e. Program to handle any exception
